# advent_of_code_2023
My take on Advent of code 2023. This year in Ruby, to prepare for the future ðŸ˜‰

## Day 1

Relatively easy, the second part was ambiguous AF and the problem wasnt well specified.

## Day 2

Today the algo was clear, I just struggled a bit with ruby's many collection methods but a healthy dose of Jetbrains AI Assistant helped me a lot.

Ruby plays out like a functional language in some situations, even if it's not. It's fine, but Scala is probably better for this mixed style.

## Day 3

God I hate 2d grids

## Day 4

In general an easy day, nothing much to say

## Day 5

Interesting problem! I liked working with ranges, made everything easier.

What I didnt like:

I'm not programming particularly performance oriented, but 32 secs for ~14 millions method calls? 

Either

* I'm missing something
* Ruby is horrendously slow

I'm leaning towards reimplementing this in scala/go/python (maintaining the domain modeling which I liked) to have a comparison.

## Day 6

Part 1 very easy: .count() is nice.

Part 2: uneventful, can be easily bruteforced. 

Smarter/more performing way would be to adopt binary search on the duration range, but it's a mass of O(1) operations so
unless the range is huge, there is no need.

## Day 7

The surprise was in part 2, as my original way of setting the order via a hash
constant is not very ruby compatible; if the method using that constant
(in this case the spaceship `<=>` comparison method) is inherited as-is, the
subclass will execute it in the context of the superclass, ignoring eventual
redefinition of the constants in the more specific class.

Not really intuitive, but the good approach would have been a single hand
with a comparator class.

## Day 8

God I hate trees

(notice this subtheme of "I hate <thing I did not study properly>")
